The mappings file contains information connecting the virtual triples to the physical stored data. The file has been obtained semi-automatically, and this better reflects how mappings are obtained in real-world when big ontologies (like NPD) are considered. The mapping consists of 1190 assertions mapping a total of 464 among classes, objects properties, and data properties. The SQL queries in the mappings, in terms of their direct DATALOG translation, count an average of 2.6 rules, with 1.7 joins per rule. We observe that the mappings have not been optimised (and, in general, one cannot expect that they are) to take full advantage of an OBDA framework, e.g., by trying to minimize the number of mappings that refer to the same ontology class or property, so as to reduce the size of the SQL query generated by unfolding the mapping. Therefore, they are suitable to evaluate the optimizations done at the mapping level by the system.
